"""Experimental validation suite for test biotope diffusion.

This module defines hypothesis-driven checks for deterministic ecosystem behavior, API constraints, and simulation invariants. The tests map computational rules to biological interpretations, including metabolic attrition, trigger-gated signaling, and O(1) spatial locality assumptions, to ensure that implementation details remain aligned with the PHIDS scientific model.
